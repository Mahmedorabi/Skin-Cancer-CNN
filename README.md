## Introduction:
-  This project aims to develop a CNN-based model to classify skin cancer images as either benign or malignant.
-  Skin cancer is a serious health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to aid in the diagnosis process.
## Dataset:
-  The dataset is divided into two main classes: benign and malignant.
-  The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using the ImageDataGenerator from the Keras library.
## Model Architecture:
-  The model architecture used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
-  The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
-  The model is built using the Sequential API in the Keras library.
## Training and Evaluation:
-  The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the fit() method in Keras.
-  The training and validation performance are monitored during the training process.
-  The final model is evaluated on a separate test set, and the classification accuracy is reported.
## Results:
-  The trained model achieves a classification accuracy on the test set.
-  Provide any additional performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, if available.
-  Include sample predictions or visualizations to demonstrate the model's performance.
## Future Improvements:
-  Discuss potential areas for improvement, such as:
    -  Exploring different model architectures or hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.
    -  Incorporating additional data augmentation techniques to improve the model's generalization.
    -  Investigating the interpretability of the model's predictions to provide insights into the decision-making process.
